# SkyWatch
Description of the mobile application and the games it provides:
Our mobile application skywatch provides several simplified resources for the young learner to learn about the satellites, missions done by NASA, and instructions used in exploring space. Afterward, the end-user gets puzzles and small quizzes. The participants who score 4000 points will be eligible to unlock the game skywatch, which allows them to build parts of space exploration instruments and satellites. When the player gets 8000 points, he/she will be eligible to unlock the second game.
Quizzes and games are not the only way players can get points; end-users can translate documents and share them in the community part of the app. That document will be checked by skywatch staff. If it is accurately translated the user will get 500 points otherwise the document will be deleted.
